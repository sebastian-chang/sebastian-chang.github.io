## About Me

I'm a sports fan, computer geek, video gamer, full-stack developer and technical engineer who loves to travel.
I work hard and learn quickly, finding enjoyment in creating out of the box solutions while being a self driven and active team player.
I have a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and a background in video technologies from my time in post production managing technical teams.
I love problem solving, especially scenarios which enable me to continue learning new developing technologies.
Always eager for the next opportunity to learn and grow personally and professionally.
